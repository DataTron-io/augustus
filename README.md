# augustus #

Augustus is an open source system for building and scoring statistical models
designed to work with data sets that are too large to fit into memory

Augustus is being redesigned.  For stable releases of the old version, see
the tags directory.  For now, we recommend that you use Augustus 0.5.2.0 or
0.5.3.0.  The trunk, when it is ready, will be released as Augustus 0.6.0.0.
