One of the file types that Augustus can use is .nab.  These are NumArray Binary
files.  This a convenient file type, but there can be a problem moving these
from machine to machine when different encodings are used.

We hope that the data files in this directory are usable on your system.  The
*_converted.csv files were generated using unitable and can be used if the .nab
files do not work on your system.

The csv files were generated on the commandline with:

  $ pyhon
  Python 2.5.4 (r254:67916, Apr  4 2009, 17:56:17) 
  [GCC 4.3.3] on linux2
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>> from augustus.kernel.unitable import UniTable
  >>> tbl = UniTable()
  >>> tbl.fromfile('wtraining.nab')
  ... method output omitted
  >>> tbl.to_csv_file('wtraining_converted.csv')
