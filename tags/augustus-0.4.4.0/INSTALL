Brief Augustus Installation
----- -------- ------------

0. Get

Download a release or checkout trunk.

    $ tar zxvf augustus-0.4.4.0.tar.gz

or check out from Subversion:

    $ svn checkout http://augustus.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/  augustus-trunk

Make sure you have Python 2.5 or 2.6 installed as well as numPy.  We prefer
numPy 1.3.1.

1. Install

There are two standard ways of installing Augustus:

The unpacked Augustus distribution can be use in-place by setting appropriate
environment variables.

For example, if augustus-0.4.4.0.tar.gz is unpacked in /usr/local, then in your
.bashrc file, include:

    AUGUSTUS_HOME=/usr/local/augustus-0.4.4.0
    export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:${AUGUSTUS_HOME}
    export  PATH=${PATH}:${AUGUSTUS_HOME}/bin

No compilation or setup step is necessary. This works if the code was checked
out from source as well, just use the appropriate names and locations.


You can also use setup.py.  The locations used are by default in PYTONPATH.
From the Augustus directory, run:

    $ python setup.py install

The installation destination can be modified by using options such as --prefix.
Use

    $ python setup.py --help

for other options.
