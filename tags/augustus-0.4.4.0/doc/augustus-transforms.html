  <p>
     It is often the case that a data sample does not display the
     precise quantities that are most appropriate for a model. There
     may be a need for providing calibration of data, aggregations, and
     so forth. PMML supports such transformations through the
     Transformation and LocalTransformation dictionary elements 
     associated with the description of a model. Users are referred
     to the PMML standard for precise definition of the relevant
     XML tags. In the following sections, the use of some of the
     more involved transformations is provided in the context of augustus.

  <br /><a class="link" href="#">Top</a><h3 id="2">2 Transformation and Local Transformation Dictionaries</h3><div class="section">
    PMML supports Transformation Dictionaries which specify how derived
    quantities are obtained. PMML distinguishes a subset of transformation
    defined in a Local Transformation Dictionary. In Augustus, Local
    Transformations are used to specify derived quantities whose values
    rely solely on the current and past state of a model segment.

  <br /><a class="link" href="#">Top</a><h3 id="3">3 Aggregations</h3><div class="section">
    Aggregrations refer to operations on a count associated with values
    for a particular field. These operations include summing the
    count value for each field value, obtaining the maxima or minima
    for field values or calculating the mean value. As specified 
    by the PMML standard, an aggregation is defined within a
    TransformationDictinary as follows:
    <Aggregation field="field" function="sum" />
    Aggregations are defined in the context of operations on sets of
    input records. Augustus supports sets of input records through
    the EventCount object. Accordingly, aggregations within Augustus
    are the result of pairings between an EventCount and one or
    more Aggregation elements.
    <h4 id="3.1">3.1 EventCount</h4><div class="section">
      Aggregations rely on histories of counts or contigency tables. These
      are supported within Augustus using an extension of PMML referred
      to as "EventCount" objects. An EventCount object tracks a counting
      variable segmented among values of a segmenting field. Note that 
      segmentation in the context of EventCount objects is different from 
      model segments referred to elsewhere. In the context of an EventCount
      object, a segment refers to the value of a field for which the
      count is observed to have some value. An EventCount object is
      declared within a Transformation Dictionary as follows:
      <EventCount field="FieldName" segmentfield="SegFieldName" />
    </div>
    <h4 id="3.2">3.2 Augustus Aggregation Treatment</h4><div class="section">
        Note that in SQL queries, which motivates the PMML aggregation
       functionality, omitting a GROUPBY (PMML groupField attribute),
       implies applying the aggregation function over the entire
       set of records. This functionality is not yet supported 
       by Augustus. Augustus uses the "segmentField" attribute of
       the relevant EventCount object as the value for the
       groupField attribute. Augustus also requires that the name
       of the relevent EventCount object be referenced with the
       PMML 'field' attribute of the aggregate element.
    </div>
    <h4 id="3.3">3.3 Examples</h4><div class="section">
      Consider the following set of input records:
      <table>
        <tr> F1; CNT1; F2 </tr>
        <tr> A; 1; X </tr>
        <tr> B; 1; Y </tr>
        <tr> B; 1; X </tr>
        <tr> A; 2; Y </tr>
        <tr> B; 3; Z </tr>
        <tr> A; 4; X </tr>
        <tr> B; 1; Y </tr>
        <tr> A; 2; Y </tr>
      </table>
      Aggregating such a set of records would yield the
      following derived quantities at the conclusion of
      a batch-scored model. 
      For aggregation, we will use the following EventCounts:
      <EventCount countField="F1" name="eventcount_1" segmentField="F2" />
      <EventCount countField="CNT1" name="eventcount_2" segmentField="F2" />
      <h4 id="3.3.1">3.3.1 multiset</h4><div class="section">
        <Aggregate field="eventcount_1" function="multiset" />
        This will yield a derived variable describing
        the following mappings between F2 values and sets:
        F2='X':{'A','B'}
        F2='Y':{'A','B'}
        F2='Z':{'B'}
      </div>
      <h4 id="3.3.2">3.3.2 count</h4><div class="section">
        <Aggregate field="eventcount_2" function="count" />
        This will yield a derived variable describing the
        following mappings:
        F2='X':3 (i.e. three occurences of F2 value 'Z')
        F2='Y':4 (i.e. four occurences of F2 value 'Z')
        F2='Z':1 (i.e. one occurence of F2 value 'Z')
      </div>
      <h4 id="3.3.3">3.3.3 sum</h4><div class="section">
        <Aggregate field="eventcount_2" function="sum" />
        This will yield a derived variable describing the
        following mappings:
        F2='X':6 (i.e. the sum of CNT values when F2 is 'X' is 6)
        F2='Y':6 (i.e. the sum of CNT values when F2 is 'Y' is 6)
        F2='Z':1 (i.e. the sum of CNT values when F2 is 'Z' is 1)
      </div>
      <h4 id="3.3.4">3.3.4 avg</h4><div class="section">
        <Aggregate field="eventcount_2" function="avg" />
        This will yield a derived variable describing the
        following mappings:
        F2='X':2 (i.e. the average of CNT when F2 is 'X' is 2)
        F2='Y':1.5 (i.e. the average of CNT when F2 is 'Y' is 1.5)
        F2='Z':3 (i.e. the average of CNT when F2 is 'Z' is 3)
      </div>
      <h4 id="3.3.5">3.3.5 max</h4><div class="section">
        <Aggregate field="eventcount_2" function="max" />
        This will yield a derived variable describing the
        following mappings:
        F2='X':4 (i.e. the maximum value of CNT when F2 is 'X' is 4)
        F2='Y':2 (i.e. the maximum value of CNT when F2 is 'Y' is 2)
        F2='Z':3 (i.e. the maximum value of CNT when F2 is 'Z' is 3)
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <br /><a class="link" href="#">Top</a><h3 id="4">4 Date and Time Handling</h3><div class="section">
    Another common set of derived attributes are those related to
    times and dates. PMML supports dates, times, and dateTimes as
    field types.
