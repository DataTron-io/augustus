    This document gives a general overview of the definition and 
    parts of PMML.
  </div>
  
  <br /><a class="link" href="#">Top</a><h3 id="2">2 Definition</h3><div class="section">
    PMML stands for Predictive Model Markup Language and it is a 
    standard way to represent models.  A model is simply an 
    expected mode of behavior based off of previous acts.
  </div>
  
  <br /><a class="link" href="#">Top</a><h3 id="3">3 Portions of PMML</h3><div class="section">
    An <a class="link" href="producedPmml.html" target="_blank">example</a> 
    is provided for the user to follow along.<br /><br />
    Due to the fact that PMML is an XML compliant language, it is 
    required to have one element that encapsulates all the others.  
    This is the &lt;PMML&gt; element.  The most current version of 
    PMML is given as an attribute to this element.
    <h4 id="3.1">3.1 Data Dictionary</h4><div class="section">
      Here a user records the names of the fields containing data 
      and their respective types that are necessary for input or 
      output from the model.
    </div>
    <h4 id="3.2">3.2 Model</h4><div class="section">
      Next some type of model is described.  Here it is either a baseline 
      or naive bayes model.  Since the contents of a model are varied, only the 
      necessary sections are discussed below.
      <p>
      All models include a &lt;MiningSchema&gt; element.
      Here a user records the names of the fields that are required 
      for scoring purposes.  Each field described here must be 
      identical to one in the data dictionary.
      </p>
      <p>
      Each model includes an element which indicates the data segment for which
      it is to be applied and the specification of any parameters needed by the model.
      For Baseline models, this element is the TestDistribution element. For Naive Bayes models, it is the NaiveBayes element. Specification of segmentation information for both models is accomplished with a &lt;Segments&gt; element found within each of the &lt;TestDistribution&gt; or &lt;NaiveBayes&gt; elements. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4 id="3.3">3.3 Test Distributions</h4><div class="section">
      This element describes a scoring action for Baseline models only.  Each time you want to 
      score an act (measure it against the model and see if the given 
      act was expected or unexpected) you go through these elements 
      (in order) until you find one that meets the <a class="link" href="segmentation.html" target="_blank">segmentation</a>
      requirements and then you produce a score according to the 
      distributions given, the test statistic and the threshold.
      <br /><br />
      Each distribution represents a probability density function that 
      models the behavior of the previously examined actions.  The 
      distribution that is contained within the baseline element models 
      the actions that are expected while the distribution contained 
      within the alternate element (if it exists) models the behavior 
      expected if the actions do not match the baseline distribution.
      <br /><br />
      The test statistic determines how the new actions are measured 
      against the distributions.  For the CUSUM statistic, the formula 
      to score (measure) this is as follows:  
      max(reset, last+log(alternatePDF(x)/baselinePDF(x)))
      where reset is the reset value (defaults to 0.0), last is the last 
      score that came from this test statistic, and log is the logarithm 
      base 10.  The reset value can be modified by adding an attribute 
      to the TestDistributions element like resetValue="165.0".  The 
      following two statistics require no alternate distribution.  The 
      zValue statistic uses the following formula to score:  
      (x - baselineMean)/baselineStdDev 
      where baselineMean and baselineStdDev are the mean and standard 
      deviation, respectively, of the baseline function.  Finally, the
      glr statistic uses the following formula: 
      1/(2*baselineVar) * max(sums) where 
      baselineVar is the variance of the baseline distribution and sums 
      is the set of values given by:  the sum where i goes from n to m of 
      (x<sub>i</sub> - baselineMean)^2, 
       m goes from n to 1, and x<sub>i</sub> 
      represents the i<sup>th</sup> score.<br /><br />
      The scores given above are, finally, tested against the given 
      threshold and a truth value is determined 
      (true iff the given measure is greater than the threshold,
       this is referred to as an alert).
     </div>
     <h4 id="3.4">3.4 NaiveBayes</h4><div class="section">
      This element describes a scoring action for Naive Bayes models only. Scoring for the Naive Bayes model means making a prediction of a value for a categorical variable. Within a model, there are multiple elements, each called a NaiveBayes element. When scoring, you go through these elements 
      (in order) until you find one that meets the <a class="link" href="segmentation.html" target="_blank">segmentation</a>
      requirements and then you produce a score (predicted value) 
      The score is calculated from the distribution of counts among the 
      different combinations of allowed input fields and values and
      output values. The counts for the various combinations are specified
      in the NaiveBayesInputs and NaiveBayesOutput elements, found 
      within each NaiveBayes element.
