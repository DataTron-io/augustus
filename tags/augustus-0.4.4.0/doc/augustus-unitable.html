   <p>The "UniTable" is an implementation of a conceptual "Universal Table" that
is at the core of the Augustus scoring engine.  The data structure is analogous
to an R frame: a table where the columns are vectors of equal length, but may be
of different types.  It is based on the Python numpy package and the programming
interface attempts to maintain consistency with the style established therein.
   </p>

   <p>The design goal was to create a very fast, efficient object for data
shaping, model building, and scoring, both in a batch and real-time context.
The key features are:
<ul>
<li> A file format that matches the native machine memory storage of the data.
This allows for memory-mapped access to the data, eliminating the need for data
parsing or sequential reading. </li>

<li> Fast vector operations using any number of data columns.</li>

<li> Support for demand driven, rule based calculations.  Derived columns can be
defined in terms of operations on other columns, including other derived
columns, and will be made available when referenced.</li>

<li> The ability to invoke calculations in scalar or vector mode transparently.
Thus, one set of rule definitions can be applied to an entire data set in batch
mode, or to individual rows incoming as real-time events.</li>

<li> The ability to handle huge real-time data rates by automatically switching
to vector mode when behind, and scalar mode when keeping up with individual
input events.</li>
</ul>

   <p>Included in the bin directory, "unitable" converts between CSV and binary
data formats. The input format is autodetected and may be binary or any flavor
of well-formed CSV.  Output formats are:

<pre>
     unitable --csv    CSV output, use --sep for custom field delim
     unitable --bin    binary output
     unitable --tbl    pretty printed table for viewing
     unitable --tty    pretty-printed table with header repeated as
                       needed to always be visible in current terminal window
     unitable --html   HTML table
     unitable --xml    XML table
</pre>
   </p>

   <p>Note that there may or may not be space savings by converting from CVS to
binary format, depending on the data.  The advantage of the binary format is in
performance gains for subsequent processing.
   </p>
   </div>

   <br /><a class="link" href="#">Top</a><h3 id="3">3 Binary file format</h3><div class="section">
   <p>The unitable binary file contains a brief text header describing field
names and formats, followed by raw binary data.  Each field is stored as a
contiguous vector of native machine types.  When "reading" a binary file, the
data is not read in the traditional sense.  Rather, a memory mapping is
established to the disk location and data is made available on-demand.
   </p>

   <p>The performance gains are spectacular.  For example, one huge CSV file
that takes an hour to read, parse, and store as internal lists takes about 45
seconds to "read" in binary format.
   </p>

   <br /><a class="link" href="#">Top</a><h3 id="4">4 Python data structure</h3><div class="section">
   <p>See unitable.py for instructions and a large list of examples.  Typical
usage is:

<pre>
     from augustus.kernel.unitable import UniTable
     tbl = UniTable()
     tbl.fromfile(filename)
</pre>
   </p>

   <p>For simple needs, tbl can be considered a dictionary where each column in
the table is stored as a separate list of values.
   </p>
   
   <p>For maximum benefit, it is necessary to understand the python numpy
module.  Each column is actually a numpy vector and supports a variety of vector
operations.  Also, the UniTable supports operations on the entire table in the
style of numpy records.
   </p>
   </div>

   <br /><a class="link" href="#">Top</a><h3 id="5">5 Known issues</h3><div class="section">
   <p>Unitable is aggressive in choosing the most appropriate data type for
records. This can cause unexpected behavior. One situation is that the
individual records in a file may not be preserved when read into unitable and
then written back to disk.
   </p>

   <p>An example which results incorrect behavior is:

<ul>
<li>Start with a csv file that has a column that consists of the strings "0" and
"1".</li>

<li>Read that file into a unitable using from_csv_file() and you will get a
column of type Bool.</li>

<li>For the data in this column, unitable chose between the integers 0 and 1,
the strings "0" and "1", and logical false and true. If the column would have
contained, say, the values "0" and "5", the the decision would have been between
literal strings and integers.</li>

<li>Write that unitable back to a file using to_csv_file() and the original
values of "0" and "1" are written as the strings "False" and "True"
respectively. These are the values that unitable uses when writing records of
type Bool to file.</li>
</ul>
   </p>

   <p>If unitable is again used to read the second file, then the behavior is
still undesirable:
   </p>

<ul>
<li>Read the new file back in and the column will be of type char(5) when it was
originally Bool. char(5) is the minimum size to hold the literal Strings "False"
and "True".</li>
</ul>

   <p>Unlike with the case when the values are "0" and "1", unitable does not
decide that this column should denote logical false and logical true.
   </p>

   <p>We are currently looking at different ways to resolve this issue.
   </p>

   <p>There are other cases that we are considering as well. For example, input
data from a spreadsheet could be intended to be treated numerically but contain
values like "INF" and "NaN".
