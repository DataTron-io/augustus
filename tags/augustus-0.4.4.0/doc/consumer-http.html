</head>
<body>
<p>The Augustus PMML Consumer is able to act as an HTTP server and accept data
via a POST request and return an alert via a response. We will look at how to
configure the Augustus PMML Consumer so that this is possible, how to send data
to the consumer and how the consumer returns results.
</p>
<h2>Configuring the consumer</h2>
<p>Configuring the Augustus PMML consumer is covered in great detail elsewhere
so we will limit our discussion to what is needed to get the consumer to accept
data via HTTP, namely the fromHTTP child element of inputData.  This element
looks like,</p>

<pre>&lt;from HTTP url="relativeURL" port="portnum" [type="UniTable"]&gt;.</pre>

<p>The <i>portnum</i> attribute is the port that the PMML consumer will listen to
and the <i>relativeURL</i> attribute is the relative URL that the requests must
be made to. Note that <i>relativeURL</i> must include a leading slash ("/").</p>

<p>(Ex. to set up a scoring enging at example.com/score
<i>relativeURL</i> must be "/score".) If <i>type</i> is present and specified as
"UniTable" (case sensitive) the input is expected to be in a CSV format,
including a header row.  Otherwise the data is expected to be XML.</p>

<h2>Sending the data</h2>
<p>Data is usually sent to the consumer in XML format so we will discuss that
first and then discuss CSV format later. To get the data to the consumer it
should be attached as the body of a POST request for the relative URL specified
in the configuration.
</p>
<h2>Getting a result</h2>
<p>If everything goes well, and it usually does, the consumer will send a 200 OK
response and the alert that is defined in the consumer configuration output
section will be the body of the response. If something should go wrong, then a
500 Server Error response will be send instead.  The consumer will always send a
response to every request.
</p>
<h2>Putting it all together</h2>
<p>A simple example of how to connect to a consumer running at /score on
port 8888 on localhost in Python is:
<pre>import httplib
headers = {"Content-type":"text/xml","Accept":"text/plain"}
conn = httplib.HTTPConnection('127.0.0.1',8888)
data = '&lt;event val1="Hello" val2="World" val3="12345" /&gt;'
conn.request("POST", "/score", data, headers)
response = conn.getresponse()
score = response.read()</pre></p>
