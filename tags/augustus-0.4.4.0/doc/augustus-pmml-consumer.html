    <h4 id="2.1">2.1 Description</h4><div class="section">
      The consumer scores data according to a model.  It requires a 
      configuration file as input to tell it where to get the model and data 
      and how to output the scores.  Optionally, an output file and port can
      be specified.  These values can be decalred in the configuration file,
      but if multiple instances are running side-by-side, these values have to
      be overridden.<br /><br />
    </div>
    <h4 id="2.2">2.2 Configuration File</h4><div class="section">
      An <a class="link" href="appendices/exampleDeployment.html" target="_blank">example</a> is provided 
      for the reader.<br /><br />
      The inputModel tag specifies where the model is located and what type of 
      file it is.  
      
      <br /><br />
      The inputData tag specifies where the data is located, what type of 
      file it is in, and (optionally) how it is to be processed.  
      
      Each possible element includes a type attribute.  Currently, 
      options for this type are either unitable or xml.  Reading from 
      files with fixed record formats is also possible with the 
      fromFixedRecordFile child element of the inputData element. 
      The name attribute of this file should indicate the file name and it
      should include a set of Field child elements used to specify the
      record format. Each Field element should include a length, name, and
      type attribute. Currently, only 'int' is supported for types. 
      <p />
      Read once should 
      be specified if the type of data is unitable.  
      <p />
      Batch scoring should be 
      specified if you wish the scoring engine to produce all scores after all 
      events have been processed. When scoring in batch mode, a single score
      is produced for each segment in the model (or one score if unsegmented).
      When not scoring in batch mode, a score is produced for each event 
      record.
      <br /><br />
      The output tag specifies how output is generated from the consumer.<br /><br />
      If the eventBased tag is in the file, the application will output a 
      report for each event that is scored, whereas if it isn't, there will be 
      a single report output which will wrap an output row for each event.<br /><br />
      The report tag specifies what tag will be output to surround each report.<br /><br />
      The toFile tag specifies where the output is to be placed.  If the file 
      already exists, then the application will append to the data that is in 
      it; however, if it doesn't exist, then the application will create it 
      and then place the data in it.<br /><br />
      The outputRow element specifies the name of the tag for each row to be 
      output to the file.<br /><br />
      Each of the following tags contains a name which specifies the tag to be
      output surrounding the data each represents.<br /><br />
      <div class="section">
        Each outputColumn tag must contain either a fieldName which is one of the 
        fields described in the data dictionary or a constant value to be output.  
        These columns will be output in order for each event scored.<br /><br />
        The score tag specifies that the value the application receives for this 
        event will be placed in this column.<br /><br />
        The alert tag specifies that the application will tell whether or not the 
        given score broke the threshold given for this test.<br /><br />
        The segments tag specifies that the application will output information 
        concerning which test produced the score.<br /><br />

    <h4 id="2.3">2.3 Usage</h4><div class="section">
      Assuming that the environment variables are specified correctly (as 
      given in the installation guide) the following command will run the consumer:<br /><br />
      <span class="command">AugustusPMMLConsumer -c config</span><br /><br />
      Where config is the configuration file.<br /><br />
      Optionally, to set the output file from the command line, you would use -o:<br /><br />
      <span class="command">AugustusPMMLConsumer -c config -o /path/to/outputfile.xml</span><br /><br />
      If you are runing Augustus in Http mode with the tag fromHTTP, the port
      attribute can be set from the command line with -p:<br /><br />
      <span class="command">AugustusPMMLConsumer -c config -p 5555</span><br /><br />
