Installing Augustus
===================

Requirements
------------

The following are required to install and run Augustus.

1. Python version 2.5, earlier versions are not supported.
2. numpy version 1.1 or later, <http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=1369&package_id=175103>

Optional Packages
-----------------

The following are not currently required but, if available,
will enhance the capabilities of Augustus.  Most of these will
be required when Augustus reaches version 1.0.

Math enhancements.

1. Python interface to R <http://rpy.sourceforge.net/>
   The tree model producer has an option to use R-rpart as an engine.

XML/PMML enhancements:

1. LXML, python interface to libxml2 and libxslt <http://codespeak.net/lxml/> 

4. Python interface to the GNU Scientific Library <http://pygsl.sourceforge.net>

Installation
------------

There are two standard ways of installing Augustus:

1. The unpacked augustus distribution can be use in-place by setting
   appropriate environment variables.  For example, if augustus-0.3.0.0.tar.gz
   is unpacked in /usr/local, then use:

     PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/augustus-0.3.0.0
     PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/augustus-0.3.0.0/bin

2. The usual python package installation steps can be used to install
   to standard locations that are by default in PYTHONPATH and PATH.
   After unpacking the distribution, in the distribution base directory run:

     python setup.py install

   The installation destination can be modified by using options such as
   --prefix (run "python setup.py --help" for more).  By default,
   this would install into:

     /usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages
     /usr/local/bin


See doc/install.html for more detailed installation instructions.
