  <br /><a class="link" href="#">Top</a><h3 id="2">2 Producer</h3><div class="section">
    <h4 id="2.1">2.1 Description</h4><div class="section">
      The producer makes <a class="link" href="appendices/pmml.html">PMML</a> files.  It requires 
      a simple PMML file as input upon which it bases the output file.  It also 
      requires a configuration file as input to tell it exactly how to make the 
      output file.<br /><br />
    </div>
    <h4 id="2.2">2.2 Input PMML File</h4><div class="section">
      An <a class="link" href="appendices/examplePmml.html" target="_blank">example</a> is provided 
      for the reader.<br /><br />
      The data dictionary section tells which fields are required as input.  
      The baseline model section describes the model.  The mining schema tells 
      which fields are required for the actual scoring process or for output.
    </div>
    <h4 id="2.3">2.3 Configuration File</h4><div class="section">
      An <a class="link" href="appendices/exampleSegmentation.html" target="_blank">example</a> is 
      provided for the reader.<br /><br />
      The configuration file specifies how to score the model.  The batch 
      element should be specified if you wish the scoring engine to produce 
      all scores after all the events have been processed.  The model 
      element tells where to find the input file and where to produce the
      output file.  The test element tells which field is to be scored, 
      which statistic to use, which test to use, and gives a value for the 
      threshold, if necessary.  The baseline element tells which function 
      and file should be used to be a basis for scoring and whether the 
      file contains XML or UniTable formatted data.  The alternate element 
      is only required for the CUSUM statistic and specifies the function 
      to be represented and either:<br /><br />
      <div class="section">
        - a file to be used to determine the mean and variance along with 
        it's data type<br />
        - a multiplier so that the mean is: [baseline's mean] + 
        ([multiplier] * [baseline's variance])<br />
      </div><br />
      The <a class="link" href="appendices/segmentation.html">segmentation</a> tag allows 
      the user to utilize different tests for different input data.  In 
      the example, the user is specifying that they want to break a day up 
      into different hours and they also want to break a country up into 
      states.  This means that the producer will find the necessary 
      functions for (in this case) 6 states and 24 hrs for a total of 6*24 
      or 144 different conditions (like 1-2 am in Texas, 1-2 am in Illinois, 
      4-5 pm in California, etc.).
    </div>
    <h4 id="2.4">2.4 Output PMML File</h4><div class="section">
      A partial <a class="link" href="appendices/producedPmml.html" target="_blank">example</a> 
      is provided for the reader.  Note that the comments from the input 
      PMML and the configuration file were completely removed from the 
      example before the output PMML file was created.  The ability to 
      transfer these comments may be added in a later version of Augustus.<br /><br />
      This PMML file specifies everything about a valid model.  The data 
      dictionary section tells which fields are required either as input or
      eventual output.  The baseline model section describes the model.  
      The mining schema tells which fields are required for the actual 
      scoring process.  And each test distribution section describes a 
      different test depending on the input conditions being correct.

    <h4 id="2.5">2.5 Usage</h4><div class="section">
      Assuming that the environment variables are specified correctly (as 
      given in the installation guide and in the FAQ toward the end of this 
      document) the following command will run the producer:<br /><br />
      <span class="command">AugustusBaselineProducer -c config -t timing</span><br /><br />
      Where config is the configuration file.  If timing is present, the producer
      will output timing information when every timing% of the data is processed.

      The consumer scores data according to a model.  For a description
      of how to consume a baseline model, please see the documentation for

    How many variables may I use for segmentation?<br /><br />
    <div class="section">
      As many as you would like.
