    Segmentation allows the user to partition the input data 
    using either string literals or real ranges.  This means 
    that the user can create multiple models within the same 
    PMML file based upon input parameters.  For instance, in 
    this <a class="link" href="producedPmml.html" target="_blank">example</a> 
    the user has broken up the data so that for every state 
    and hour combination there is a different model.

    It would be rather tedious to calculate the mean and 
    variance for each distribution by hand (especially since 
    there could be thousands of them to calculate) so 
    Augustus contains a producer that fulfills this function.<br /><br />
    <h4 id="3.1">3.1 Defining Segments</h4><div class="section">
      An <a class="link" href="exampleSegmentation.html" target="_blank">example</a> 
      producer configuration file is provided for the user.<br /><br />
      The segmentation tag denotes the definition of the 
      segmentation for this model.  Within it there may be 
      any number of explicit and/or regular segment 
      declarations; however, there may only be one 
      declaration per field.<br /><br />
      The explicit segment declaration identifies the field the 
      restriction is placed upon as the state field and then 
      lists the possible values (there may be any number of 
      these).  The regular segment declaration declares the 
      field the restriction is placed upon as the hour field 
      and then states that the producer is to create 24 ranges 
      of equal length between the numbers 0 and 24.  There can 
      be any number of these partition declarations.<br /><br />
      When the producer creates the models, it will make a 
      distinct model for all possible sets of the values (or 
      ranges) choosing one from each declaration.  In our 
      example, this means that there will be 6 (# of states) * 
      24 (# of hours) = 144 (number of segments) different 
      models.

    <h4 id="3.2">3.2 When to use segments</h4><div class="section">
      Segmentation is used so that multiple predictive models 
      can be used to improve the overall performance of the 
      combined model.  For example, when scoring the average 
      amount of rainfall recorded for a region one could break 
      up the data into rainfall for certain regions (which has 
      a huge impact on average rainfall data) and month (which 
      also has a huge impact on average rainfall data.)  This 
      allows for more accurate results when scoring data.
