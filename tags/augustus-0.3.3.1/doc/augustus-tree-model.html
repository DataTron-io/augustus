  <br /><a class="link" href="#">Top</a><h3 id="2">2 Producer</h3><div class="section">
    <h4 id="2.1">2.1 Description</h4><div class="section">
      The producer creates <a class="link" href="appendices/pmml.html">PMML</a> files.  It requires 
      a simple PMML file as input upon which it bases the output file.  It also 
      requires a configuration file as input to tell it exactly how to make the 
      output file.<br /><br />
    </div>
    <h4 id="2.2">2.2 Input PMML File</h4><div class="section">
      An <a class="link" href="appendices/tree_exampleInput.pmml.html" target="_blank">example</a> is provided 
      for the reader.<br /><br />
      The data dictionary section tells which fields are required as input.  
      The tree model section describes the model.  The mining schema tells 
      which fields are required for the actual scoring process or for output.
      The field that is being predicted must have usageType="predicted" in the
      mining schema and the fields that are being to predict the above field must
      have usageType="active" in the mining schema.
      <br />
    </div>
    <h4 id="2.3">2.3 Configuration File</h4><div class="section">
      An <a class="link" href="appendices/tree_producerExample.xml.html" target="_blank">example</a> is 
      provided for the reader.<br /><br />
      The configuration file specifies how to score the model.  The model 
      element tells where to find the input file and where to produce the
      output file.  The tree element contains paramaters to the model
      building process.  The maxdepth attribute specifies how large of a
      tree will be build and functionName tells the producer to build a
      classification model (eventually support may be added for regression
      tree models.)  The data element identifies the file to be used to be
      a basis for the resulting model and whether the file contains XML or
      UniTable formatted data.
      The <a class="link" href="appendices/segmentation.html">segmentation</a>
      tag allows the user to utilize different trees for different input
      data.  In the example, the user is specifying that they want to use
      the model solely to score data from the month of December.
      <br />

    <h4 id="2.4">2.4 Output PMML File</h4><div class="section">
      An <a class="link" href="appendices/tree_example.pmml.html" target="_blank">example</a> 
      is provided for the reader.  Note that the comments from the input 
      PMML and the configuration file were completely removed from the 
      example before the output PMML file was created.  The ability to 
      transfer these comments may be added in a later version of Augustus.<br /><br />
      This PMML file specifies everything about a valid model.  The data 
      dictionary section tells which fields are required either as input or
      eventual output.  The tree model section describes the model.
      The mining schema tells which fields are required for the actual 
      scoring process.  Each Node section describes a 
      different tree used to score data when the
      corresponding input conditions (segment) are correct.

    <h4 id="2.5">2.5 Usage</h4><div class="section">
      Assuming that the environment variables are specified correctly (as 
      given in the installation guide and in the FAQ toward the end of this 
      document) the following command will run the producer:<br /><br />
      <span class="command">AugustusTreeProducer -c config -t timing</span><br /><br />
      Where config is the configuration file.  If timing is present, the producer
      will output timing information when every timing% of the data is processed.

      The consumer scores data according to a model.  For a description
      of how to consume a tree model, please see the documentation for

    Do I have to specify environment variables?<br /><br />
    <div class="section">
      Yes:
      <div class="section">
        PROJECT must point to <span class="directory">project</span><br />
        PYTHONPATH must point to <span class="directory">augustus</span> and 
        <span class="directory">project</span><br />
      </div>
    </div><br />
    How many variables may I use for segmentation?<br /><br />
    <div class="section">
      As many as you would like.
